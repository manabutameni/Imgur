ABOUT

This is a quick bash script I wrote to download an entire imgur album while keeping the order of the images as they appear on the album. I did this by renaming the file so if you still want to reference the original imgur album I would recommend bookmarking it somehow.


USAGE

The script was created so that all that you need to do is copy+paste the address bar link into the terminal.

chmod +x imgur
./imgur https://www.imgur.com/a/qwerty

INSTALLATION

This is only if you want to reference the script without having it in the directory you want the imgur album.

mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
cd /usr/local/bin
curl -O https://raw.github.com/manabutameni/Imgur/master/imgur
chmod +x imgur
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin # only if you haven't done this already
export PATH
